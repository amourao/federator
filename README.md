## Federator
Rank fusion library that takes ranks in the TREC format and can combine them using multiple types of score and rank based rank fusion techniques (e.g. CombSUM and variants, RRF, ISR and variants).

It can also be easily extented to allow for novel rank fusion techniques (check the examples in the fusion_functions.py).
